                <p>
                    Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts 
                    a victim's files, making them inaccessible. Cybercriminals 
                    behind ransomware attacks often demand a ransom payment in 
                    cryptocurrency to decrypt the files. These attacks can target 
                    individuals, businesses, and organizations, causing significant 
                    financial losses and disruption.
